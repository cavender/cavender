### I study the physiological and evolutionary dimensions of plant ecology that influence community assembly and ecosystem function. I am very interested in the genetic and evolutionary basis of variation in plant phenotypes and spectral properties that can advance remote sensing of biodiversity. I am committed to advancing spectral biology to help understand and monitor the diversity of our living ecosystems. My goal is contribute to active management to maintain a habitable planet for humanity.
